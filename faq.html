        <h3>My Main Advice:</h3>
        <p> My main advice on learning Japanese is to study it every day and stay motivated. Podcasts, anki flash cards, reading books, and studying grammar from grammar books are all great ways to study. You should start out with memorizing hiragana and katakana, then move on to simpler kanji before studying complex kanji and grammar. Acting like a Japanese person who is fully immersed in the language every day is the best way to get a grasp of Japanese. Good luck!

        <h3>Question 1: What is the difference between onyomi and kunyomi? Why does stroke order matter? How can I learn more Kanji?
        </h3>
        <p>I have pinned videos that answer these questions with detailed explanations! I also recommend using all the resources on my linktree!

        <h3>Question 2: Is memorizing radicals important?</h3>
        <p>Kanji are like building blocks. For example, 日 is a building block of 星. A great way to start is with simpler kanji, but I don’t want to misguide people into feeling they have to start with needing to know radicals. Many radicals are never used alone in Japanese, so it isn’t necessary to know them. For example ⺤ is a radical in the kanji for love 愛, but is never used on its own. Very little information you take in from memorizing radicals is applicable to truly understanding Japanese. You can learn radicals through learning kanji and recognizing that they are in other kanji you have encountered.

        <h3>Question 3: Why don’t you include every single reading for certain kanji? 
        </h3>
        <p>It is very unlikely you’ll be able to memorize the thousands of kanji based on kunyomi and onyomi readings alone. There are some readings that you will almost never encounter in real life, so it's not necessary to worry about them. Instead, focus on memorizing vocabulary, since you are learning the readings of the kanji through that process anyways. I try to include the most important and useful vocabulary in my videos, so focus on that section!

        <h3>Question 4: I want to learn Japanese, but I don’t care about reading or writing. Do I still need to learn kanji?
        </h3>
        <p>I would recommend studying kanji anyways even if your goal is to learn Japanese for fluency in listening and speaking. It helps fully immerse yourself in becoming fluent, although you don’t have to focus on kanji as much if that isn’t your goal. Studies have shown that writing things down helps you memorize them better, so the vocabulary you’ll encounter in conversations will be from when you studied reading and writing.

        <h3>Question 5: What other resources do you recommend?
        </h3>
        <p> I have a linktree on my website with a book on learning thousands of Kanji and articles that I believe explain Japanese concepts very well.
